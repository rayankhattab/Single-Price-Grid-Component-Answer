This is my first Frontend Mentor Challenge. 
It took me about 3 hours to complete it.

After editing the HTML file to have an organized basic structure with appropriate class names, I began styling in SASS.

Within a container, I centered all the elements. Then, I sectioned my HTML with Flexbox, twice. The first Flexbox included the columns and the second, the rows.
I tried to estimate the appropriate padding, margin, font size in order to mirror the given sketch.
I also used box-shadow to give depth to the design, as well as, appropriate border-radius values to match the original.

The button is also styled accordingly. It has a hover state that pushes it up a couple of pixels, changes shadow coloring and darkens the background color a bit.

Finally, I moved to the media queries, where at max-width:425px, the rows are stacked as columns, to provide optimal viewing experience for mobile users. 

Mostly, I've done similar styling techniques before, so this wasn't hard at all, but this helped me freshen up my memories and train my abilities. 
I hope with practice it'll take less time for me to complete similar challenges.
